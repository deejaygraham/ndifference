It works with published assemblies via reflection \r\nand does not require the original source code.\r\n\r\nIt performs static analysis on .Net assemblies, providing built-in inspectors for the most common checks and \r\nsupports loading of custom inspectors. Analysis is performed at the library, assembly and type level.\r\n\r\n## Product Inspection\r\nThe following is a list of built-in product level inspections:\r\n\r\n* Removed assemblies\r\n* Changed assemblies\r\n* Added assemblies\r\n\r\n## Assembly Inspection\r\nThe following is a list of built-in assembly level inspections:\r\n\r\n* Changed target architecture\r\n* Changed assembly references\r\n* Removed types\r\n* Added types\r\n* Obsolete types\r\n* Changed types\r\n\r\n## Type Inspection\r\nThe following is a list of built-in type level inspections:\r\n\r\n* Constant values\r\n* Enum values\r\n* Abstraction\r\n* Constructors\r\n* Derivation\r\n* Events\r\n* Fields\r\n* Finalizers\r\n* Interface implementation\r\n* Methods\r\n* Properties\r\n* Sealing\r\n* Obsolete members\r\n* Taxonomy\r\n\r\n## Reporting\r\nThere is a built-in reporting capability for common file formats but custom reporting is supported too.\r\n\r\n## Extensibility\r\nBoth the inspection rules and the report output are customisable.\r\n\r\n## Prior Art\r\nThe original inspiration for this project came from Microsoft's unsupported \r\n[libcheck](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11287) tool.\r\n\r\n## CI Status\r\nThe project builds on Travis: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deejaygraham/ndifference.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deejaygraham/ndifference).\r\n\r\n## Get Involved!\r\nHave an idea about improving the project? Please get involved. NDifference is an open source project (of course) and we accept \r\ncontributions!
